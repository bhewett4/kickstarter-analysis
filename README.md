# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of project is to determine trends of success of different campaigns based on either their launch date or funding goal
### Purpose of project is to discover how these trends may lead towards different fundraising strategies in the future
## Analysis was accomplished using Microsoft Excel, specifically integrating nested if functions, conversion of dates, pivot tables, and charting of compiled data. My primary challenge was properly formatting the nested if's in order to properly generate the data for the count of successful, failed, and canceled for each range of funding goals
### When reviewing the final data, there are some strong conclusions that can be drawn from both sets of data. With regards to outcomes based on the launch date, we find that far more theater productions are launched when spring starts to turn into summer (largest peak in May) and additionally, of this surge in launches, the ratio of successful to failed productions is approximately 2:1. Additionally, when reviewing the results of projects in relation to their funding goals, we see that overall the lower the funding goal, the higher the likelihood of a successful project. Funding goals less than $1,000 had a 76% success rate and those with a funding goal of $1000 - $4999 had a 73% success rate. 
### Regarding challenges and difficulties, when trying to perform analysis on other campaigns that were not in the theater category, I found there to be very little data for many of the parent categories and subcategories. A more robust data set would lead to the ability to offer a wider range of productions. I feel that we could also add a pie chart to the Outcomes based on Goals for each the successful and failed categories in order to offer additional visualization.
## Combining the two sets of compiled data together, we find that in order to have the highest chance of success, a project should be launched in May and have a funding goal of less than $1,000.
